[War Rugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_rugs) are Afghani textiles including woven representatinos of weapons, political figues, maps, and military vehicles- visual motifs from over a century of armed conflicts in the country. 

The earliest war rugs pre-date the 1979 Soviet invasion, depcting leaders like Amanullah Khan.

Following the Soviet withdrawal, political commentary often takes the form of Mohammad Najibullah as a puppet of the USSR.

Drone imagery appears in the 2010s, and has been the subject of controversy.
